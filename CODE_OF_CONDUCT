- LIMIT WORK-IN-PROCESS: Finish processes as often as possible stablishing milestones to improve
- REJOYCEMENT: Modestly celebration of successes. Product owner shared results including customer feedback. Team complements each other.
- COMPANY MEMBERS DRESS CODE: Due to the seriousness of spiritual and charity issues we expect our company members to dress appropriately in business attire. Because our work environment includes temples, and religious leaderships are part of our clientele, professional business attire & customs are essential for our reputation. The formality of our business attire makes clients and customers feel that they can trust our judgment and recommendations.

Ask your manager or PR first before you share company news that’s not officially announced. Avoid any defamatory, offensive or derogatory content. You may violate our company’s anti-harassment policy if you direct such content towards colleagues, clients or partners. If you handle our social media accounts or speak on our company’s behalf, we expect you to protect our company’s image and reputation. Specifically, you should: Be respectful, polite and patient. Avoid speaking on matters outside your field of expertise when possible. Follow our confidentiality and data protection policies and observe laws governing copyrights, trademarks, plagiarism and fair use. Coordinate with our [PR/Marketing department] when you’re about to share any major-impact content. Avoid deleting or ignoring comments for no reason. Correct or remove any misleading or false content as quickly as possible.
- COMPANY MEMBERS RELATIONSHIPS:In this policy, “dating” equals consensual romantic relationships and sexual relations. Non-consensual relationships constitute sexual violence and we prohibit them explicitly. If you start dating a colleague, we expect you to maintain professionalism and keep personal discussions outside of our workplace. You are also obliged to respect your colleagues who date each other. We won’t tolerate sexual jokes, malicious gossip and improper comments. To avoid accusations of favoritism, abuse of authority and sexual harassment, supervisors must not date their direct reports.

This includes incitement to hostility against any individual, including encouraging self-harm. This also involves posting or threatening to post other people's personally identifiable information (doxxing) online.
- PERSONAL ATTACKS: Conflicts inevitably arise, but dissatisfaction should never turn into a personal attack. It is not appropriate to insult, humiliate or belittle others. Attacking someone for their opinions, beliefs and ideas is not admissible. It is important to speak directly when we disagree. However, these discussions need to be conducted in a respectful and professional manner, with a focus on the issue at hand.
- HARMFUL, DEROGATORY OR OFFENSIVE LANGUAGE RELATED TO:
Religion (or lack thereof); life history; physical appearance; family situation; genre; gender identity or expression; marital status; sex; sexual orientation; mother tongue; age; capacity; deficiency; race and / or ethnicity; nationality; socioeconomic condition; geographic location; any other dimension of diversity are not tolerable. This includes intentionally referring to a person for a gender to which they do not identify and / or questioning the legitimacy of gender identity.

We will treat the acts that influence or guide these activities in the same way that we treat the activities themselves, and the same consequences will be applied.

## 5. COLLABORATIVE PROCESSES & MEDIA USAGE:
Recording and publishing faith-inspired media raises a number of ethical issues. As the Ecumenic Creative Operations projects evolves, we strive for awareness and thoughtful discussion of these concerns, as well as a methodology that is sensitive to both the communities we create with and the audiences we engage in faith-inspiration industriousness. The following explores some of the pressing questions our research team has encountered:
- DIGNIFIED RULE OF LAW RESPECT: Our company members knowing of God's omniscience and also the ever increasing world data usage know that their media usage must be respectful to our code of conduct. You must try to not watch or assist obscene, offensive or illegal material. You must not send confidential information to unauthorized recipients, invade another person’s privacy and gain access to sensitive information, download or upload pirated movies, music, material or software, visit potentially dangerous websites that can compromise our network and computers’ safety, nor perform unauthorized or illegal actions, like hacking, fraud or buying/selling illegal goods.
- RECOGNIZING OUR BIASES AND PRIVILEGES AS RESEARCHING ARTISTS: We recognize that as researchers, we carry biases and privileges, including the power to shape how a community is portrayed. These issues may become especially prominent in certain communities - such as those that do not speak our language, those of different socioeconomic status, and those whose beliefs differ from - or even clash with - our own. In each situation, we do our best to acknowledge and ameliorate these factors. For instance, when we don’t understand the language spoken by community members, we collaborate with someone who does, who can help us communicate more clearly with those around us. When we encounter groups whose ideologies may seem foreign or offensive to us, we try to set our own beliefs aside; we strive to listen to community members, rather than judge or challenge them. We always seek after the best consultants avaiable possible to our possibilities, the same way we aim at sharing financial prosperity properly with our collaborators, transparently accountably.In all communities, we also aim to heed cultural norms and expectations, rather than abiding by our own. If at any point in our relationship with a community the members wish to end the collaboration or decline further participation, we will honor those wishes.
- COMMUNITY SELECTION: There are multiple reasons why we choose to record specific faith-inspired practices and communities. Sometimes we seek in activities that we wish to document, other times we select communities as the result of general outreach on the part of members of our team or from members of a given religious community. We have selected religious groups that fall under research themes (such as ecoforestry development ministries) and we have selected groups when they have made themselves publicly visible around a current event. We recognize that the decision to create with a certain religious communities is never value-free nor make us its representative. Every time we make a selection, we run the risk of implying the legitimacy or importance of some religious groups over others. With this in mind, the Ecumenic Creative Operations makes a conscious effort to produce work of both breadth and depth. We take an expansive approach to faith-inspiration, spirituality, and religiosity, seeking to embrace diverse examples of local faith-inspired actions enacted by people of multiple traditions, genders, ethnicities, languages, and nationalities. We also look and listen beyond the most accessible communities - those that speak our same language or those whose beliefs are most familiar. At the same time, the Ecumenic Creative Operations also openly acknowledges – and works to address – inherent limitations to our in-fieldwork, including geographic constraints, staff size, and the unpredictable amenability of communities. We do not claim that our productions are representative of all or even most faith-inspired artworks in the communities wih which we collaborate. Rather, we seek to gather a diverse collection of faithful creativity with our glocal communities.
- PRIVACY AND CONSENT: The Ecumenic Creative Operations projects operates with the previous contractually agreed approval of our hosting institution. Our process for obtaining permission to records and materials varies by community and situation. In small communal settings, we directly ask people for permission to record, also informing them about the scope of our project and potential uses of our recorded material. In larger communal settings, we ask a community leader to provide a similar introduction to all those present. In public settings, such as protests or fairs, where it is often impractical to obtain everyone’s permission, we endeavor to make our presence known. We do not record stealthily, and we carry our recorders openly. We try to avoid recording individual conversations or identifiable persons without first obtaining permission. All of our researchers hand out printed documents to explain our project, and cconduct code, allowing community members to make an informed choice about whether or not they would like to participate. Whenever possible, we distribute informational postcards about the project, which includes our contact information for questions and concerns. In all situations, anyone who does not wish to participate in our project has the opportunity to alert us, and we will avoid recording them in an identifiable way.
- MEETINGS DISCIPLINE: Our meetings guests are asked to wear properly in respectful formal creative clothing avoiding miniskirts or other indiscreet and unseemly clothes. Bermuda shorts, slippers, t-shirts, caps, slogans or logos t-shirts, sports teams or clubs are inappropriate and will be noticed.
- SELECTING MEDIA & CREATIONS FOR DOCUMENTATION RECORDINGS: A similar concern arises when we decide what constitutes a “faith-inspired” creation, and consequently, what is important for our researchers to record in a given community. Some of the Ecumenic Creative Operations’s most valuable insights have arisen from recordings of unexpected or non-traditional religious practices, such as the chatter of temple members as they prepare a meal together, or the way children make small houses for birds in the woods. Community members, however, often have their own perceptions of which actions are religious, as well as preferences for how these are to be documented and represented. We often rely on community members’ descriptions of their meaning for their own religious group leaving space for outer contradictory views. On more than one occasion we have returned to religious groups for a second process when the members have requested that we included additional aspects from their community faith-basement that they felt would more aptly represent their group on a publicly accessible contemporary artwork. The choice of what defines a faithful creation in a particular context as well as which of them represent a religious group is part of the ongoing conversations that we have with our research teams, partner institutions, the glocal cultural museologic heritage safeguard network, and the communities that we work with. The work of the Ecumenic Creative Operations is a careful balancing act between honoring dignified ethic community sensitivity and compassionate listening with our own critical, interpretive semiotic framework. We recognize that our choices imply certain value judgments, which we try to maintain as transparent as possible, and we strive to incorporate community perspectives, improving it, whenever possible.
- EDITING AND COMBINATIONS OF SAMPLES & CREATIONS: The Ecumenic Creative Operations centers on an interactive process of faith-inspired artworks creation through collaborative theorical lectures and practical workshops. Another significant feature of the project is our selection of curated exhibits and interpretive collages, each made by digitally combining segments from original recordings. We feel such editing is necessary to our work, as it allows us to call attention to devotional patterns, relationships, and points of import that might otherwise go unnoticed. Ethical concerns inevitably arise when documentary material is altered creatively, including those about fair and accurate representation. How do we responsibly decide which content to clip from a piece or documentation recording, which content is representative of the community or event? How do we ensure that our content is not misleading? With these kinds of questions in mind, we developed our in-field research guidelines when editing original material in the most transparent way. When making actions, we stay as true as possible to original content or pedagogically making the transformation noticeable. Our editing is always based on metalinguistic recursive methodologically presenting the creative process itself involving providing multimedia contextual material for  all our performances and exhibits. Each is accompanied by details of time and location, explanatory writing derived from the in-field research notes, and often, by photographs of the original event or practice. We propose the creation and maintainance by the community of a comprehensive archive of original, unedited documentary recordings, to which visitors may request access in order to understand our collaboration process and their initial context relating to the communitary religious base. On the occasions when we creatively combine material into collages, the resulting pieces are clearly noted as such. Lastly, when any edited material is potentially problematic, we consult with community members in the presence of a neutral third-party referee.
- CLASSIFYING SAMPLES & CREATIONS: From the start of our project, we have engaged in conversations about how best to organize our databases. At the center of this conversation is our in-process agreed use of digital tagging as both an ethical and research-compatible practice. In order to catalogue the faith-inspired creations that we have gathered, we have created tags and filter categories related to faith-based traditions, types of creative techniques, locations, times and dates, and other fields that we imagined would be relevant to future researchers who explore our materials. Our tagging system has evolved with our project. We have added new categories and modified existing ones as we have gathered new data and solicited community input. Tagging and categorizing are powerful research tools with both great potential and some clear deficiencies. On the one hand, tagging and filtering allows visitors to our site to quickly search and explore our sonic archive, and to find unique relationships among sets of data. These tools, however, also construct a paradigm that may exclude or marginalize some practices, and potentially, by extension, the communities that they represent. Also problematic is the process of categorizing creativity that contain multiple kinds of media and techniques, which forces us to decide which tags to prioritize and use. Additionally, while we intend for the language of our tags be neutral, they may carry unanticipated connotations for community members. We acknowledge these potential issues and are continually reviewing our tagging practices in relation to our ongoing collection of recordings and community partners, making adjustments as we grow.
- ARTWORKS COPYRIGHT AND USAGE: Sermons, music, performances, and many other varieties of faith-inspired artoworks often constitute intellectual and creative property. Therefore, we make every effort to secure any needed rights to make use of the materials that we record in a fair-trade compliant procedure. The Ecumenic Creative Operations uses recordings commercially only under consentment with a contractually agreed share-holding. The core purposes of our project are educational, and we do not sell or otherwise profit from the recordings and edited clips/collages that we produce unles the community desires to do it under our guidelines and policies. Likewise, visitors to our artworks are not permitted to download or distribute our materials without express written permission, unless otherwise decided collectively with the process stakeholders. Participants may contact us at any time with concerns, and if necessary, we can remove or adjust the material in question.
