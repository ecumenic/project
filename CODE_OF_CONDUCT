## 4. EXPECTED BEHAVIOURS:
We expect the following behaviors:

4.1. RESPECTFUL POSTURE:
- Value the ideas, the styles and the points of view of each one. We will not always agree, but this does not justify disrespectful behavior. Be open to different possibilities and assume your mistakes. Be gentle in all interactions and communications. Be aware of the impact of your actions and how this may affect people. Be direct, constructive and positive. Take responsibility for the repercussion of your acts and your mistakes. If someone says they have been harmed by your words or actions, listen carefully, sincerely apologize, and change their behavior.

4.2. BE POLITE, DIRECT AND PROFESSIONAL:
Be kind to the the every other collaborators, being discrete into their personal matters. We are here to solve our joint enterprise problems. Discussions are likely to be made about whether a criticism is respectful and whether it is not. We need to be able to speak directly, honestly, directly and politely. 

4.3. BE INCLUSIVE:
Get to know your neighbors. The multiplicity of points of view and of people stimulates innovation and increases knowledge, even if it is not always comfortable. Help the new prospects to be heard. Think about how you can facilitate alternative ways of contribution and / or participation.

4.4. UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES:
The goal is not to "win" every divergence or argument. It is more productive to be open to ideas that enhance our own knowledge. Strive to be an example of inclusive thinking. "We win" when different perspectives enrich and strengthen our lives.

4.5. VALUE AND ADAPT TO SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES:
Cultural differences can cover everything from religious practices to personal habits and dress. Be respectful to people who adopt different cultural practices, attitudes and beliefs. Work to eliminate your own discriminatory prejudices, trends and patterns. Think about the needs of others from their point of view. Refer to people in the way they prefer (including pronouns) and in appropriate voice.

4.6. CROSSCULTURAL DIGNIFICATION:
It is unrealistic to expect everyone to know the cultural practices of all ethnic groups, but everyone must recognize that one's culture is only part of one's relations.

4.7. LEAD BY EXAMPLE:
By combining your actions with your words, you become a person that others want to follow. Design your community for inclusion. Be responsible and take responsibility for inclusive behaviors. Make decisions based on the best possible contribution.

Conflicts inevitably arise, but dissatisfaction should never turn into a personal attack. It is not appropriate to insult, humiliate or belittle others.

However, these discussions need to be conducted in a respectful and professional manner, with a focus on the issue at hand.
